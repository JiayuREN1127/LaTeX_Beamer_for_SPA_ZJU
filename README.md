# LaTeX_Beamer_for_SPA_ZJU 


### Introduction  
A slides/presentation/beamer template based on **LaTeX**, and it is especially for you who are studying at ***School of Public Affairs, Zhejiang University***. The colors and logo/icon pictures are all SPA-themed.  
+ The author has designed (by herself) and developed (mainly with the help of Copilot) this template because several respected classmates had once shown their interests and approvement towards it, and she always appreciates that.
+ The author wants to specifically note the source of this template, and promote a more normative and wider use of it.
+ She will be very delighted if the user gives her any feedback.
+ Any terms of application for profits or commercial purpose are **NOT** acceptable.
